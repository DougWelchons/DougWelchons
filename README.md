### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a former construction project manager turned software developer. While I was still working as a Project Manager, I needed a scheduling tool. So, in my spare time, and more for fun than the actual practicality, I made a scheduling tool in Excel. It was a bit cumbersome and had its fair share of bugs and quarks, but when I took a step back, I realized I loved the process and needed to change careers into software development.

I took the first step and enrolled in Turing School of Software and Design's Backend program, a seven-month intensive boot camp (60+ hours a week) focused on backend development with Ruby on Rails. While there, I also acted as a mentor for students coming up behind me and reimplemented the "Rock and Pebble" program, which paired students in their first module with someone the module ahead of them. This proved to be a mutually beneficial program, with mod 1 students receiving additional help and guidance while mod 2 students further cemented their understanding of the fundamentals by teaching them to others.

After graduating, I wanted to revisit that old scheduling Excel file and remake it properly. On-Schedule was born, a passion project and a simple nod to that fateful Excel file. I have continued to work on it, returning to it when life allows or when I have some idea I want to try out or learn about.

Outside of work and software development, I love being outdoors, enjoying the beautiful Northern Montana forests and mountains, camping, hiking, or watching the wildlife. When it's cold and gets dark early in the winter, I love playing board games such as Wingspan, Terraforming Mars, and many others. I'm also a black belt martial artist and PADI SCUBA Dive Master.

I also do my best to pass along all the skills and life lessons I have learned over the years, and volunteer work is very important to me. Some of the volunteer work I have been a part of includes;
 - I worked with veterans suffering from extreme PTSD, as well as other physical or mental traumas, Teaching them how to SCUBA dive as a form of focus and therapy.
 - I taught different self-defense classes designed to address the specific situations children, women, and men might likely find themselves in, how they differ, and the psychology of survival.
 - I volunteered as a mentor at Turing, helping new students get a headstart in the tech industry.
 - I currently volunteer with a Youth organization called Sea Cadets. Their mission statement is in part "...to build leaders of character by imbuing in our cadets the highest ideals of honor, respect, commitment, and service."

### And for some of those fun prompts by GitHub...
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finding a new job, but I'm also using this opportunity to continue development on On-schedule, mostly to keep my skills as sharp as possible.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and CSS, mostly. But really, anything I can get my hands on. I've done a little backend work in Go (and would love to do more), firmware with C#, mobile development, and Windows applications. It's all exciting, interesting, and mentally engaging. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you like...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: sorry I don't give out my personal information, but you can drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/douglas-welchons/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was buried alive once as part of a Discovery Channel production so that they could dig me up on camera... and they didn't even leave it in the final cut.
